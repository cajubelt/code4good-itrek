				<h2>Presentation Session</h2>
				<p>
					The last career development session was a judged presentation session. Each Trekker prepared 
					a presentation that will be given at a minimum of two high schools. Their presentations were 
					judged by STEM and non-STEM professionals. After being given feedback, the program ended 
					with a Cuban dinner in Miami which was attended by Warren Marcus, a local MIT alumni bio 
					research professional. This final networking opportunity officially ended the Trek.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the program proved to be full of learning opportunities. Each Trekker was able to 
					gain new skills and improve on others. They left the program understanding how they can take 
					initiative to find and create opportunities that will help them progress toward their research 
					and professional goals.

				<h2>Testing and Aquarius Presentation</h2>
				<p>
					Samples collected the previous day were evaluated at MarineLab in order to affirm their 
					predictions. The evening was another networking activity, a visit to Florida International 
					University to attend a MIT alumni event. This event was a presentation of Aquarius, the 
					only underwater research center in the world currently in operation. Researchers in Aquarius 
					Skyped in to give a tour of the facility and describe life underwater. A recent MIT graduate, 
					who would be living in the facility, also presented on the research she would be conducting. 
					The event culminated with the Trekkers being able to network with professionals and entrepreneurs.

				<h2>Final Testing</h2>
				<p>
					The day was spent doing final tests at two different coral reef locations collecting 
					research samples using some newly designed equipment.  This showed promising results and 
					helped define the questions and procedures that should be presented to users.

				<h2>Professionalism Course Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					Monday was spent finishing the professionalism course that was started on June 2nd. 
					This part of the course focused on presentation skills, research skills, social media, 
					and time management. The course involved creating effective presentations and other 
					activities such as writing an abstract, preparing an e-calendar and developing career-friendly 
					social media profiles. Some of these skills would prove useful to the Trekkers during their 
					final presentations and when drafting the final research document.

				<h2>Activity Day!</h2>
				<p>
					After a full week of activities, the Trekkers were allowed a day to explore Miami on their 
					own. Each Trekker did a different activity ranging from zoo visits to go kart racing.

				<h2>Habitat Restoration</h2>
				<p>
					To give back to the local community, the Trekkers participated in a community service 
					activity. Trekkers spent the day restoring the habitat of the endangered Schaus Swallowtail 
					butterfly on Adam’s island which is part of Biscayne National Park.  This activity was 
					organized by Mark Walters, the local Sierra Club Outings Chair of the Miami Group, in 
					conjunction with the National Park Service.  On the way home from this very hot day of 
					physical labor, Mark led them to the famous Robert is Here Fruit Stand where they had 
					smoothies and milkshakes and he introduced them to fruits they had never even heard of before.  All agreed that the visit to this place was worth the hard work earlier.

				<h2>Collected Samples Evaluated</h2>
				<p>
					Samples collected the previous day were evaluated at MarineLab in Key Largo, Florida and 
					adjustments were made to the equipment and plan. For the evening career development session, 
					each student was instructed to prepare an elevator pitch. Each Trekker had to deliver their 
					pitch and was feedback was provided by the i-Trek volunteers.

				<h2>Preliminiary Dive</h2>
				<p>
					As another Trekker earned his PADI certification, the Trekker’s research plan and equipment 
					were tested with a preliminary dive at two different coral locations. The evening involved 
					dinner with Winston Walters, a neurological researcher at the University of Miami School of 
					Medicine who also manages the lab. This event was very insightful because he shared 
					information about his work and on how to pursue a career as a researcher.

				<h2>Data Collection Planning</h2>
				<p>
					Two of the four participants passed the scuba certification course and were awarded PADI 
					certifications. After the Trekkers were certified, they started fine tuning their data 
					collection plan and equipment. This included roles for each Trekker, building a plankton 
					net to be use to collect samples on the surface and constructing a rig to hold an underwater 
					camera.
				</p>
				<p>
					The evening event involved a networking event consisting of a Skype call with a MIT graduate 
					student in a field relevant to the research project. The Trekkers were able to ask relevant 
					questions about their research project and graduate school in general.

				<h2>Interview and Calling Skills</h2>
				<p>
					The majority of the day consisted of continued scuba certification training.
					The next career developing session, held in the evening, involved the Trekkers 
					participating in the first part of a professionalism course. The first part of 
					this course focused on interview skills and conference call etiquette. After receiving 
					a brief explanation of do’s and don’ts for interviews, each Trekker played the role of
					interviewer and interviewee in a round of mock interviews and graded each other on 
					their etiquette, responses and body language. Afterwards, the Trekkers and 1 i-Trek 
					volunteer went to different parts of the house and participated in a conference call to
					define research roles. Three of the them played the role of a different disruptive 
					person while the leader of the call, who was one of the Trekkers,  had to manage
					each person on the call while having a successful conference call.

				<h2 style="padding-bottom:15px;">Scuba Certification and Career Development</h2>
				<p>
					In order to adequately define the scale and test its effectiveness, 
					the Trekkers needed to collect data on several coral reefs. 
					This is easiest done while diving. Therefore, each Trekker participated 
					in scuba certification classes that would take three to four days.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conjunction with data collection and preparation, four volunteers 
					facilitated career development sessions, networking sessions and a 
					community outreach activity. These sessions began with a presentation of Grad 
					Catalyst during the evening of the first scuba certification day. The 
					Grad Catalyst is a presentation produced by MIT’s Office of the Dean of 
					Graduate Education to educate underrepresented students on how to increase 
					their chances of being admitted to top tier graduate programs.
